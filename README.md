# CharacterCreator

This project was made for a job interview.

In order to run it, you'll need mongoDB, node/npm and angular cli.
First of all, run a localhost version of mongoDB (run `mongod` in a terminal). Then you'll just have to clone this project, run `npm install` and `npm start`, and you'll be free to try it.

When you launched the project, it'll be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
